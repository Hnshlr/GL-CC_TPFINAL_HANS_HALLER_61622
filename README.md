# ISEP - CLEAN CODE - TP FINAL
### Project by Hans Haller, Id NÂ° 61622

## About the project structure :

This project uses Java 1.8 SDK.

Please note :

* The class ShoppingCart, certainly only containing a List of Products, has been created if there were others objects to be added to the ShoppingCart.
* The class DoubleHandler was created to define a method to handle .0001 and .9999 exceptions using mathematics formulas. This allow us to use native Java double type.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
